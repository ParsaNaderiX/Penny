"""Checkpoint loading + model-family dispatch shared by every XAI method.

Every ``crypto.train_*`` script writes ``best.pt`` as
``{"model": state_dict, "config": dict, ...}`` and every model class takes a
single ``config`` dict in its constructor and exposes
``predict(batch, device) -> (B, 3)`` logits (see ``utils/evaluate.py``). This
module is the one place that maps a model name to its class so XAI code
doesn't hardcode imports per method.

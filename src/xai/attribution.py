"""Unified attribution interface: every XAI method returns a ``(T, F)`` map.

All four models consume the same ``(B, 1, T, F)`` window (rows = LOB levels /
trade features, columns... actually time is axis 2 and features axis 3 — see
``crypto/features.py``), and every model exposes
``predict(batch, device) -> (B, 3)`` logits (``utils/evaluate.py``). Pinning
every attribution method to that one shared ``(T, F)`` output lets per-model
native methods (attention, gates) and shared gradient methods (Task 2) be
plotted and compared on identical axes.

``ClassifierFn`` wraps whatever forward path a model needs for classification
(joint_diffusion models must go through the clean-window ``t=0`` inference
path, not the noised denoiser) into the single signature every attribution
method below expects: ``(B, 1, T, F) -> (B, 3)`` logits.
